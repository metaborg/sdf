This is a copy of the strategies package of SDF3 (org.metaborg.meta.lang.template), because extensibility of languages in Spoofax 2 is a little messed up and you can directly refer to Java code from another language, even in an extension. This will likely be much better in Spoofax 3, where languages compile down to just jars.
